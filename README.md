# ADE-PINN-Masters-Thesis-Code

Codes used in master's thesis by Ketil Fagerli Iversen. Python code based on Pierre Jacquier's code in https://github.com/pierremtb/PINNs-TF2.0.
Training data generated by MATLAB used to optimise PINNs can be found at https://mega.nz/file/it9QjbhD#wHOpcVoCflcs0wrKuDOrrbF9xFBe7vj9IjD5gFQysr8.
The path needs to be specified by the user for the PINNs to work. This can be done for example by: path = os.path.join("/folder/2D_ADE_Training_Data.mat")
